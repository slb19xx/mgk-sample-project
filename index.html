Machine Gun Kelly is currently touring US and Europe in support of his latest project.

            Known for his unique nail art as much as his eclectic fashion sense, Machine Gun Kelly launched his own unisex nail polish collection in Decemeber 2021 as another way to express his creative vision. UN/DN's product line continues to grow every few weeks and now has over 20 shades available. Recently they debuted their first collab with streetwear brand Lonely Ghost featuring 4 new shades, nail art stickers, and merch.

          <p>
            After playing manny/barista Wes in 2016's Showtime series <em>Roadies</em>, it's no surprise MGK opened up his own coffee lounge in his hometown of Cleveland in August 2020. The decor pays tribute to the anomolous group of artists lost too soon at the age of 27 like Jimi Hendrix, Amy Winehouse, and Kurt Cobain, while the lounge's menu features carefully curated coffee, food, and signature cocktails.
