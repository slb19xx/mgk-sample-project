            Known for his unique nail art as much as his eclectic fashion sense, Machine Gun Kelly launched his own unisex nail polish collection in Decemeber 2021 as another way to express his creative vision. UN/DN's product line continues to grow every few weeks and now features over 20 shades. Recently they debuted their first collab with streetwear brand Lonely Ghost that includes 4 new shades, nail art stickers, and merch.

            After playing manny/barista Wes in 2016's Showtime series <em>Roadies</em>, it's no surprise MGK opened up his own coffee lounge in his hometown of Cleveland in August 2020. The decor pays tribute to the group of artists lost too soon at the age of 27 like Jimi Hendrix, Amy Winehouse, Mac Miller, and Kurt Cobain, while the lounge's menu features carefully curated coffee, food, and signature cocktails.

            In June 2022 Hulu released the Sam Cahill-directed documentary <em>Life in Pink</em> which chronicles Machine Gun Kelly's life over the past 2 years. The film is an in-depth look at the ups and downs of the rising star. Fans old and new get an unprecedented look into the life of the man behind the music reminiscent of MGK's vlogs-before-vlogs-were-a-thing YouTube series <em>Kellyvision</em>.
